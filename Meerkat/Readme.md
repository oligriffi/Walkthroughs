### The Brief:
As a fast growing startup, Forela have been utilising a business management platform. Unfortunately our documentation is scarce and our administrators aren't the most security aware. As our new security provider we'd like you to take a look at some PCAP and log data we have exported to confirm if we have (or have not) been compromised.

### Task 1
We believe our Business Management Platform server has been compromised. Please can you confirm the name of the application running?
